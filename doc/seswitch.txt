INTRODUCTION                            *seswitch*

The seswitch plugin consists primarily of the |:SeSwitch| command.
This command is used to quickly switch between Vim sessions.
The author uses it primarily on his phone, where use of more than a few tabs
is impractical and only one vim instance is running at any one time
via the excellent DroidVim app:

Use follows the following general pattern:
- Start Vim
- :SeSwitch aardvarks
  - opens the "aardvarks" session, with its various tabs and windows
    containing information on aardvarks to be processed and/or perused.
    - This is equivalent to :source $sessionfilename but sets
      seswitch's session name variable.
  - make some important updates to the details of how aardvarks snuffle food
  - :SeSave
    - make sure the session state is maintainedâ€”cursor moved
      to the location of the recent change, for example.
  - open new tab containing new "Aliens.txt" buffer
  - add text indicating that ALF is not related to aardvarks
- :SeSwitch platypus
  - delete all buffers related to aardvarks, closing their windows and tabs,
    and open another set of files with information on the platypus
  - :normal oTHERE CAN BE ONLY ONE
- :SeSwitch aardvarks
  - save the platypus session, re-open the aardvarks session where we left off,
    with the tab containing "Aliens.txt" selected.

SETUP                                   *seswitch-setup*

Add to .vimrc, for example:

    let g:seswitch#device_name = 'Nokia3360'
    let g:seswitch#session_dir = '~/.vim/Sessions'

With these settings, seswitch will look for and create session files
matching ~/.vim/Sessions/device--Nokia3360/*.vimsession

COMMANDS                                *seswitch-commands*

                                        *:SeSwitch*
:SeSwitch[!] [session_name]
                        Delete all buffers and open the named session.
                        Save the session first unless ! is given.

KNOWN ISSUES                            *seswitch-issues*

Some known issues
  - uses hardcoded path separators, thus presumably not compatible with Windows
  - similarly, no checks are made on session name characters
    so it is possible to use character incompatible with some filesystems.
  - needs documentation of commands
