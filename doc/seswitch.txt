Add to .vimrc, for example:

    let g:seswitch#device_name = 'Nokia3360'
    let g:seswitch#session_dir = 'Sessions'
    " With these settings, issuing the command
    "     SeNew French
    " or
    "     SeSwitch French
    " will result in the creation of a file named
    "     Sessions/Nokia3360-French.vimsession
